Finding Useful Coding Resources When You've Hit a Wall 

**Draft:**
Whether you're bored during summer or want to learn new skills, expanding your coding skills is a great idea. Knowing how to program is invaluable knowledge, not matter what level of mastery you're at, and using your free time to continue learning and diving deeper into the world of coding will . And as a bonus, it gives you the ability to build and create awesome projects with a lot more flair and creativity. 

Here, we'll go over some tips and suggestions on how to 

**Taking coding lessons with freeCodeCamp**
 
One great place for you to start as a newbie to coding is [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). This nonprofit organization helps users code through hands-on projects and structured, easy-to-manage lessons. 

In addition to their learning platform, they also have Youtube videos and can connect you to a community of others who are just as excited about coding as you are. 

If you're feeling particularly ambitious, they offer certification programs too in topics like responsive web design and Javascript algorithims and data structures. 
  
**Putting your new coding skills to work**

So you've built up some coding skills. Where do you go from here? Now you can begin cool projects that you get to show off later on. These can be as simple as a website portolio that you code from scratch — maybe in a code editor like [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) — or getting a little more complicated like an app that chooses what you eat for dinner. 

Your projects are only limited by your imagination, and even if you're feeling a bit stuck, you can seek out inspiration from others online too. 

**Using W3Schools for coding references** 

Sometimes if you need other examples of coding while you're working on your project, [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) is a good place to go.They only offer written tutorials, but it's a good reference point. 

Here, you can sort through examples they provide in the coding language you are using to see where your code might be causing problems. You can even open the code editor for each example and try playing around to  gain a better understanding of the concept you're trying to grasp. 

**The Power of Googling**

The few resources I listed above may get you started on learning coding, but you should know that your list of options doesn't end there. Search engines are your best friends as it's likely you might need some extra assistance while working on your project later on. If you don't always have someone to turn to and ask questions, the internet is always there for you. 

If you are confused about how to code something in particular, detailed walkthroughs in Youtube tutorials could help you out a lot. Or you can find other coding lessons for free from many other sites like [Khanh Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming) that might better suit your learning style. 

Sometimes you have to get specific with what you're searching for to get faster, better results. If you get can't find what you're looking for right away, it can be be frustrating. But don't give up! The internet gives you plenty of free resources at your fingertips within seconds.

Now that you know a couple of ways to navigate the internet for coding resources, the possibilites are endless. You can learn as little or as much code as you want, all without paying for expensive classes. Use what you learn to start your own project — perhaps a website, an interactive fiction, an app — and share what you create with others.
