How to Find Coding Resources if You're New to Tech

**Draft:**
Why not dip your toes into the world of coding if you have some extra time on your hands? Whether you're bored during summer or want to learn new skills, learning a bit of coding is a great idea. Knowing how to code is invaluable knowledge, not matter what level of mastery you're at. And as a bonus, it gives you the ability to build and create awesome projects with more flair and creativity. 
  
**What is coding?**

This might seem like a basic question, but if you're brand new to coding, its good to go over the basics! In sum, coding is using programming languages to tell a computer how to behave. As a coder, you're using the computer's language to make it do something. 

This could be as simple as making your font bigger and bolder, or it could be more complicated, like coding a video game. 

**What are some coding languages?**

You've probably already heard of some languages that coders and progammers use in their work: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, etc. 

When I was first introduced to coding, I learned HTML and CSS. HTML is sort of like the bare bones of the internet; it displays documents in web browsers. CSS is a stylesheet that affects how HTML is displayed, such as fonts, colors, formats. Essentially, HTML dictates what the content is, and CSS dictates how that content looks.  

These weren't too difficult to learn, and if you're not sure where to start, you can start here  to get a better understanding of coding in general. (Sidenote: HTMl is actually a markup language because it doesn't have any programming logic like other languages.)

But if you really want to become more advanced with coding, languages like Javascript and Python could be more up your alley. Javascript makes web designs more interactive, which engages users more than just HTML and CSS. Python is often used for creating web applications, and it is versatile for both small and big projects. 

Depending on what you want to learn, you might better enjoy learning some languages over others. Take a couple minutes to research and gain a better understanding of what skills you hope to build before diving straight into learning. 

**Taking coding lessons with freeCodeCamp**
 
 One great place for you to start as a newbie to coding is [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). This nonprofit organization helps users code through hands-on projects and structured, easy-to-manage lessons. 

In addition to their learning platform, they also have Youtube videos and can connect you to a community of others who are just as excited about coding as you are. 

If you're feeling particularly ambitious, they offer certification programs too in topics like responsive web design and Javascript algorithims and data structures. 
  
**Putting your new coding skills to work**

So you've built up some coding skills. Where do you go from here? Now you can begin cool projects that you get to show off later on. These can be as simple as a website portolio that you code from scratch — maybe in a code editor like [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) — or getting a little more complicated like an app that chooses what you eat for dinner. 

Your projects are only limited by your imagination, and even if you're feeling a bit stuck, you can seek out inspiration from others online too. 

**Using W3Schools for coding references** 

Sometimes if you need other examples of coding while you're working on your project, [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) is a good place to go.They only offer written tutorials, but it's a good reference point. 

Here, you can sort through examples they provide in the coding language you are using to see where your code might be causing problems. You can even open the code editor for each example and try playing around to  gain a better understanding of the concept you're trying to grasp. 

They offer lots of examples in many different languages, so hopefuly it can be helpful to you no matter what you're coding in. 

**Finding more coding resources**

The few resources I listed above may get you started on learning coding, but don't think that your list of options ends there. Search engines are your best friends here. 

You can look up more detailed walkthroughs of coding concepts in Youtube tutorials, or you can find other coding lessons for free in many many other sites like [Khanh Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming). 

Sometimes you have to get specific with what you're searching to get faster, better results. If you get stuck, it can be be frustrating. But don't give up! The internet gives you plenty of free resources at your fingertips within seconds.
  
Now that you know a couple of ways to navigate the internet for coding resources, the possibilites are endless. You can learn as little or as much code as you want, all without paying for expensive classes. Use what you learn to start your own project — perhaps a website or an interactive fiction — and share what you create with others.
